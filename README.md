# create-native-di
> Creates an npm package that is ES6 and React native Ready.
react native cli reactor with built-in protocols includes core packages such as native-base, mobx, moment, lodge and ES6 support, and an in-house inject for contacting the api or fake.store. ^^

## Installation

First, install [Yeoman](http://yeoman.io) and [Native DI](https://www.npmjs.com/package/generator-native-di) using [npm](https://www.npmjs.com/) (we assume you have pre-installed [node.js](https://nodejs.org/)).

```bash
sudo npm install -g yo
sudo npm install -g generator-native-di
```

Then generate your new project:

```bash
yo native-di
```

Then install package:

```bash
npm install
```

If your project has any issues with the native folders, you can rebuild them by deleting both the ios and android directories at the root level of your project and running this command:

```bash
react-native eject
```

Then link package 
[react-native-vector-icons](https://github.com/oblador/react-native-vector-icons),
[react-native-signature-capture](https://github.com/RepairShopr/react-native-signature-capture):

```bash
react-native link react-native-vector-icons
react-native link react-native-signature-capture
```

Run project:

```bashb 
npm run ios
```
